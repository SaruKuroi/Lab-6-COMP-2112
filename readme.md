# Progressive Enhancement Essay

One of the strongest arguments defending the notion that progressive enhancement ought to be the traditional model where content is always accessible is the following quote:

>"The insight of offline-first is that, when you optimize for conditions where the network is unavailable, you end up making a better experience for everyone, even those on blazing-fast connections."

On the other hand, those who take the view that progressive enhancement has changed such that JS running on a browser can be safely assumed and that the network is now the enhancement will argue:

>"Different sites are optimized for different use cases, and I wouldnâ€™t be so presumptuous as to tell folks that they all need to be building websites exactly the way I like them built."

In my view I am in favor of the progressive enhancement method as it practices inclusivity allowing any user to access the information a web page holds regardless of browser, device, or internet connection. However, I do think if one has an idea for a website that can only be made through heavy use of javascript, they shouldn't be limited by pre-conceived notions on how a website **should** be made. Progressive enhancement should be seen as a default guideline and something to strive for, but if it cannot be helped, there should be no shame in deviation.
